Movie Database Setup Documentation

This console application manages a movie database using a relational database structure. 
Below are the SQL commands to set up the required tables:

1. Database Creation and Selection:

   CREATE DATABASE movie_db;
   USE movie_db;

2. People Table:
   - Stores information about individuals involved in movies (directors and actors).
   - Each person is identified uniquely by their id.

   CREATE TABLE people (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
       birth_year INT NOT NULL
   );

3. Movies Table:
   - Stores details of each movie including title, director, release year, and length.
   - The director_id column references the id of the director in the people table.

   CREATE TABLE movies (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       director_id INT,
       release_year INT NOT NULL,
       length INT NOT NULL,
       FOREIGN KEY (director_id) REFERENCES people(id)
   );

4. Movie Actors Table:
   - Manages the many-to-many relationship between movies and actors.
   - Each record links a movie_id to an actor_id.
   - The primary key (movie_id, actor_id) ensures uniqueness of movie-actor pairs.

   CREATE TABLE movie_actors (
       movie_id INT,
       actor_id INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (movie_id) REFERENCES movies(id),
       FOREIGN KEY (actor_id) REFERENCES people(id),
       PRIMARY KEY (movie_id, actor_id)
   );


5. Connecting to Your MySQL Database:
   - To connect to your MySQL database, modify the DSN (Data Source Name) in your Go application:

dsn := "your_username:your_password@tcp(localhost:3306)/movie_db"
